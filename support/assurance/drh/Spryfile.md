# Diabetes Research Hub (DRH) SQLPage Application

This script automates the conversion of raw diabetes research data (e.g., CSV,
Parquet, or a private data warehouse export) into a structured SQLite database.

- Uses Spry to manage tasks and generate the SQLPage presentation layer.
- surveilr tool performs csv files conversation and transformation to RSSD
- Uses DuckDB for data transformation.(file meta ingest data,meal fitness
  data(if present),combined CGM data)
- Export back to sqlite db to be used in SQLpage

## Setup

## Environment variables and .envrc

This project reads configuration from environment variables. All variables
listed below must be set in your `.envrc` file for the pipeline to run.

### Pipeline & Study Configuration (Required for `prepare-db` task)

These variables link your study data to the ETL process:

- **`STUDY_DATA_PATH`**: The path to the folder containing your raw study files
  (e.g., `raw-data/synthetic data`). This is the **input folder** for the
  ingestion process.
- **`TENANT_ID`**: A unique, short identifier for your study or tenant (e.g.,
  `FLCG`). Used for metadata tracking.
- **`TENANT_NAME`**: The full, human-readable name for your study or
  organization (e.g., `"Florida Clinical Group"`).

### Core Tool Configuration

- **`SPRY_DB`**: The database connection URL used by SQLPage and Spry. Example
  value used here: `sqlite://resource-surveillance.sqlite.db?mode=rwc`

  - Scheme: `sqlite://` followed by a path (relative or absolute) to the SQLite
    file.
  - Query `mode=rwc` tells SQLite/DuckDB to open the file for read/write and
    create it if missing.
  - If you prefer a path under a `data/` directory, set e.g.
    `sqlite://./data/resource-surveillance.sqlite.db?mode=rwc`.

- **`PORT`**: The TCP port the local SQLPage server or other local web component
  should listen on (example: `9227`).

Recommended practice is to keep these values in a local, directory-scoped
environment file. If you use direnv (recommended), create a file named `.envrc`
in this directory.

POSIX-style example (bash/zsh):

```envrc prepare-env -C ./.envrc --gitignore --descr "Generate .envrc file and add it to local .gitignore if it's not already there"
export SPRY_DB="sqlite://resource-surveillance.sqlite.db?mode=rwc"
export PORT=9227
export STUDY_DATA_PATH="raw-data/synthetic-data/"
export TENANT_ID="FLCG"
export TENANT_NAME="Florida Clinical Group"
direnv allow
```

Then run `direnv allow` in this project directory to load the `.envrc` into your
shell environment. direnv will evaluate `.envrc` only after you explicitly allow
it.

---

## Security and repository hygiene

- Never commit secrets or production credentials into `.envrc`. Treat `.envrc`
  like a local-only file.
- Add `.envrc` to your local `.gitignore` if you keep secrets there.
  Alternatively commit a `.envrc.example` or `.envrc.sample` with safe,
  non-secret defaults to document expected variables.
- The SQLite file (e.g. `resource-surveillance.sqlite.db`) is a binary database
  file — you will usually not check this into version control. Add that filename
  or the `data/` directory to `.gitignore` as well.

Why these variables matter here

- The YAML header at the top of this `Spryfile.md` reads
  `database_url: ${env.SPRY_DB}` and `port: ${env.PORT}` — Spry and the SQLPage
  tooling will substitute those environment values when building or serving the
  site.
- The `prepare-db` task explicitly checks for `STUDY_DATA_PATH`, `TENANT_ID`,
  and `TENANT_NAME` and will halt if any are missing.
- If `SPRY_DB` is not set, the tooling may fail to find the database or fall
  back to defaults; explicitly setting it ensures predictable, repeatable dev
  runs.

Quick troubleshooting

- If the server does not start on the expected port, verify `echo $PORT` (or
  `echo $SPRY_DB`) in your shell to confirm values are loaded.
- If direnv appears not to load `.envrc`, re-run `direnv allow` and ensure your
  shell config contains the direnv hook.

### Instructions

- Prepare your research data files according to the supported formats listed at
  [drh.diabetestechnology.org/organize-cgm-data](https://drh.diabetestechnology.org/organize-cgm-data).
- Use [latest surveilr](https://github.com/surveilr/packages/releases)
- Place the study data files in a **directory** in the same path as this
  `Spryfile.md`, then run the following command:
  - `./spry.ts task prepare-db`
- The `prepare-db` task, requires the **study data folder path**, **tenant ID**,
  and **tenant name** as parameters which are provided through env.

```bash prepare-db --dep prepare-env --descr "Validates ,Extract data , Perform transformations through DuckDB and export to the SQLite database used by SQLPage"

## SQLPage Dev / Watch mode

While you're developing, Spry's `dev-src.auto` generator should be used:

```bash  --descr "Generate the dev-src.auto directory to work in SQLPage dev mode"
./spry.ts spc --fs dev-src.auto --destroy-first --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json
```

```bash  --descr "Clean up the project directory's generated artifacts"
rm -rf dev-src.auto
rm -f *.sql
```

In development mode, here’s the `--watch` convenience you can use so that
whenever you update `Spryfile.md`, it regenerates the SQLPage `dev-src.auto`,
which is then picked up automatically by the SQLPage server:

```bash
./spry.ts spc --fs dev-src.auto --destroy-first --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json --watch --with-sqlpage
```

- `--watch` turns on watching all `--md` files passed in (defaults to
  `Spryfile.md`)
- `--with-sqlpage` starts and stops SQLPage after each build

Restarting SQLPage after each re-generation of dev-src.auto is **not**
necessary, so you can also use `--watch` without `--with-sqlpage` in one
terminal window while keeping the SQLPage server running in another terminal
window.

If you're running SQLPage in another terminal window, use:

```bash
./spry.ts spc --fs dev-src.auto --destroy-first --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json --watch
```

## SQLPage single database deployment mode

After development is complete, the `dev-src.auto` can be removed and
single-database deployment can be used:

```bash build-deploy --descr "Generate sqlpage_files table upsert SQL and push them to SQLite"
rm -rf dev-src.auto
./spry.ts spc --package --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json | sqlite3 resource-surveillance.sqlite.db
```

## SQLPage Build and Server Execution

```bash build-run-server  --descr "Build and run starts execution"
./spry.ts spc --fs dev-src.auto --destroy-first --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json
SQLPAGE_SITE_PREFIX="" sqlpage
```

## Layout

This cell instructs Spry to automatically inject the SQL `PARTIAL` into all
SQLPage content cells. The name `global-layout.sql` is not significant (it's
required by Spry but only used for reference), but the `--inject **/*` argument
is how matching occurs. The `--BEGIN` and `--END` comments are not required by
Spry but make it easier to trace where _partial_ injections are occurring.

 SELECT
'text' as component,
'

The **Combined CGM Tracing** refers to a consolidated dataset of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, collected from multiple participants in a research study. CGM devices track glucose levels at regular intervals throughout the day, providing detailed insights into the participants'' glycemic control over time.

In a research study, this combined dataset is crucial for analyzing glucose trends across different participants and understanding overall patterns in response to interventions or treatments. The **Combined CGM Tracing** dataset typically includes:
- **Participant ID**: A unique identifier for each participant, ensuring the data is de-identified while allowing for tracking individual responses.
- **Date_Time**: The timestamp for each CGM reading, formatted uniformly to allow accurate time-based analysis.(YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
- **CGM_Value**: The recorded glucose level at each time point, often converted to a standard unit (e.g., mg/dL or mmol/L) and stored as a real number for precise calculations.

This combined view enables researchers to perform comparative analyses, evaluate glycemic variability, and assess overall glycemic control across participants, which is essential for understanding the efficacy of treatments or interventions in the study. By aggregating data from multiple sources, researchers can identify population-level trends while maintaining the integrity of individual data.
